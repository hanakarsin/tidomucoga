"One told me they don't know where to get testing, and that I should not seek out testing," she wrote.

Tests are reserved for those who have been outside of the U.S. in the past two weeks, as well as people who have come into contact with a diagnosed person.&nbsp;</p><p>Lauren M. Sauer, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, called the requirements “too stringent, and people aren’t getting tested.”</p><p>“I’ve heard from so many colleagues that tests were turned down,” she added. &nbsp;</p><p>The tight requirements are likely the result of a lack of testing kits, which also need to be sent to a CDC laboratory for diagnosis.&nbsp;</p><p>President Donald Trump has pledged a rapid expansion of the country’s testing capacities. As many as one million tests could be administrated by the end of the week, according to Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the viral Twitter thread has caused some concern. Others who claim to have gone through a similar process also shared their experiences.</p><p>"Nobody is getting tested because it’s unavailable," one user claiming to be a nurse wrote. "This is how the number of cases is so small and why it will keep spreading."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>As a nurse in primary care in MA, I can attest that what you experienced is the same process here.
