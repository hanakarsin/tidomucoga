The family of Mary has arranged a marriage for her. The fearless Mary is not for it, and the situation forces her to flee away from home. She finds refuge in a sweet and charismatic man who has a movement that he preaches to. This man is Jesus.</p><p class=align-left>It is odd how Mary gets to be the only person who comprehends Jesus' preachings. She understands Christ's message better than the twelve disciples. The cast in the 2018 film includes Rooney Mara who played Mary Magdalene, Joaquin Phoenix playing Jesus, Chiwetel Ejiofor who was cast as Peter and Tahar Rahim as Judas.</p><h3>20.
