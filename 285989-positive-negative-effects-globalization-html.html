Globalization is driven by policies enacted by the government, which are designed to unlatch economies both domestically and internationally in order to strengthen the development in poor or developing countries in a view to raise the living standards of people. Effects of globalization have created an international free market that has mainly become advantageous to multinational corporations in the Western world, which has affected smaller businesses, cultures and common people. Let us take a look at what these effects are.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/0fgjhs6q6me1psv2f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Globalization is also a social, cultural, political and legal phenomenon. What are the effects of globalization? This is a question that has been answered all over the world. Social effects of globalization represent greater connectivity among global populations. The impact of globalization on culture has represented the exchange of ideas and values among cultures and created a trend toward the development of a single world culture. Political effects of globalization have shifted countries' political activities to the global level through intergovernmental organizations like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. As a legal phenomenon, globalization has altered how international law is created and enforced. Here are a few positive and negative effects of globalization;</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs45ns39010oo.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Africa Is A Hotbed For Crypto Adoption And It Is Not Slowing Down</span></p></a><h2>Positive effects of globalization</h2><h3><strong>1. Increase in employment opportunities</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Globalization has influenced the growth of employment opportunities since many companies have set up businesses all over the world. So many people are able to get a variety of jobs without having the inconvenience of moving to other countries to search for employment opportunities. Currently, companies such as Google, Microsoft, Delta, Toyota etc, have their offices in other countries.</p><h3><strong>2. The effect of globalization on education</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Globalization has influenced people to move from one country to another in search of educational opportunities. It has become convenient for students to move globally in search of better quality education, which has led to the integration of cultures. People from poorer countries seeking improved education move to developed countries in order to acquire it. An example is India, students from India are moving to countries like the UK and USA to pursue higher education.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3cdde240b5996ca4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 recent trends in entrepreneurship you shouldn't ignore in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ MORE: Thinking of studying abroad in Europe? Think Czech College</strong></p><h3><strong>3. Increase in free trade</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Globalization has led to an increase in free trade which has opened doors for investors in developed countries to set up their businesses in developing countries. Multinational companies from developed countries have the freedom to operate in developing countries as a form of increasing their employment opportunities and infrastructure.</p><h3><strong>4. The faster flow of information</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Through globalization, information sharing has been improved and its flow all over the world has been heightened. Crucial information can be transferred from one person to another and between corporations in a matter of seconds. It has influenced the ease of transportation of people, goods, and services all over the world.</p><h3><strong>5. Increase in the quality of goods and services</strong></h3><p class=align-left>As a result of globalization, people have access to the best quality of goods and services throughout the world. Companies have to strive to provide better quality goods and services to the consumer and the consumer has the liberty of choosing whichever product he thinks is best suited for his needs. This allows a person in America to wear clothes made in India and Mexico while watching a football match taking place in England on a TV made in China.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4331263082dcbf41.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is the role of Information Technology in communication?</span></p></a><h3><strong>6. Decrease in the prices of goods and services</strong></h3><p class=align-left>As the competition in the market has increased due to rapid globalization, producers have to price their products competitively in order to remain in the market. This has become a boon for the consumer as he can get better quality products at cheaper prices.</p><h3><strong>7. Reduction in cultural barriers</strong></h3><p class=align-left>As people move from one country to another, barriers between various cultures tend to decrease. This has resulted in tolerance and openness towards other cultures. This has also facilitated communication between different cultures. It has also led to a reduction in wars as we are today living in one of the most peaceful periods in the history of mankind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs45ns39010oo.jpeg><h2>Negative effects of globalization</h2><h3><strong>1. Environmental degradation</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Developed countries can take advantage of underdeveloped countriesâ€™ weak regulatory laws in terms of environmental protection.</p><h3><strong>2. Unfair working conditions</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Many multinationals have been accused of social injustice by exploiting labor in underdeveloped countries in order to cut costs. This has provided unhealthy working conditions leading to health hazards. Many large companies have also been accused of using child labor in their factories in underdeveloped countries.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/163b08d551ccbcd2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 10 most conservative countries in the world in 2021</span></p></a><h3><strong>3. Fall in employment growth rate</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Though the promotion of the idea that the advances in technology and increase in productivity would create more jobs has been a cornerstone of globalization, it has been seen in the past few years that such advances have led to a decrease in the employment growth rate in some developing economies. This can also be attributed to the fact that companies move their production facilities from one place to another in search of cheaper labor, once the workers in the previous country start demanding better wages.</p><h3><strong>4. Growing disparity between the rich and the poor</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Most of the worldâ€™s resources are said to be consumed by the richest of the world population. This means that the poorer population only gets to consume very little of the worldâ€™s resources. This is a direct result of globalization according to some activists who believe that globalization only serves the rich, whereas the poor have to face its disadvantages.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/33579f468953d79e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best African countries to live and work in 2020</span></p></a><h3><strong>5. Globalization makes a poor country poorer</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Globalization can make the economy of a county collapse, especially countries that struggle due to competition by multinational corporations. For instance, there are countries that offer cheap labor which can never be matched by developed countries. For example, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">in China, the costs of manufacturing are cheap that even Apple, which is a multinational American company, is not able to resist the temptation of having everything made ther</a>e and assembled back in America. This kind of practice, which is integral to globalization and rationally unavoidable, can ruin the economies of countries that donâ€™t have the advantage of labor, low wages and other elements such as weaker labor laws, lenient policies pertaining to doing business and willful corruption that often helps industries.</p><h3><strong>6. Small-scale industries face extinction</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Small-scale industries which are indigenous to a particular place face extinction as they do not have the resources or the power that the multinational companies have. As a result, these small industries are unable to compete with bigger companies and they then go out of business. An example is a bamboo furniture-making industry in India. The manufacturers work out of their homes and work hard to make furniture out of bamboo. These workers cannot compete with large companies selling cheap plastic furniture and as a result, their industry faces extinction.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/42a99a23a3ba7b21.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 most expensive cities in Africa for expats in 2024</span></p></a><h3><strong>7. The rapid spread of deadly diseases</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Deadly diseases such as AIDS or other communicable diseases can spread at a very fast pace via travelers or due to other means as a direct consequence of globalization.</p><h3><strong>8. Too much dominance is given to a limited number of countries</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Globalization isn't without a lot of deficiencies and a few perils. Globalization, especially like industrialization and the previous colonization, can make one nation or district ground-breaking. Whoever gets the opportunity to overwhelm worldwide exchange and trade or has the assets to be the essential provider and not the customer will have a higher ground. Having the world or a significant piece of the world rely upon one country, or a specific gathering of organizations can be greatly inconvenient to the balance of power and influence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3cdde240b5996ca4.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ MORE: Theories of International Relations Made Easier: Understand the Concept</strong></p><h2>Effects of globalization in Kenya</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4b08b0de82ec70ce.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 7 types of diplomacy in international relations</span></p></a><li>As globalization gripped Africa, there was a rise in democracy through multiparty elections in Kenya. Finally, people had the authority and power to elect the leader they wanted without any fear.</li><li>Kenya finally has a constitution that is progressive in terms of the laws created. Human rights are recognized and protected in these constitutions. Kenya has remained the most progressive country by its 2010 constitutions in comparison to countries like Uganda, Sudan, and Zimbabwe.</li><li>Liberalization of the economy in Kenya has led to the privatization of state corporations for efficiency and better service provision. Kenya privatized its entities owned in telecommunication, water, and railway as it sought better service delivery to Kenyans. Due to this, fresh capital and leadership controlled the companies to greater heights. They moved from being loss-making companies to profit-making companies, though some are still struggling at the moment.</li><li>Globalization in Kenya has led to a digital awakening. Kenya is now an IT hub in Africa with some of the greatest innovations being born as a result of this. Mobile money transfer businesses and mobile banking services have revolutionized Kenya. It has influenced people in Kenya and you might find that there are more people online using their mobile phones in Kenya than in any other country in East and Central Africa.</li><li>Communication has been much easier across Kenya with the advent of technology. This has made Kenya to have a good communication in terms of interaction with neighboring countries. Diplomatic relations with other countries has been made much easier through the use of technology. It is easier to have a Skype/video conference with someone thousands of miles away in real time. Countries are now connected and have bilateral relations.</li><li>Kenya, like other African countries such as Nigeria, Angola, Uganda, and Ghana, has resources like oil. The demand for oil is huge and still growing, which has led to a rise in the cost of raw materials around the world. International companies are setting up shop in Africa. Africa is trading more with the east than the west. Some scholars refer to this as â€˜neo-colonialismâ€™ but others are looking at it as â€˜fading western influence in Africa'.</li><li>Kenyaâ€™s cheap labor is making the country a hub for export processing zones among other trade initiatives. Globalization has also led to international mobility among Kenyans. Thousands of Kenyans work, study, and live abroad and many more are either going or planning to go abroad. It has provided a lot of opportunities for Kenyans, an idea that was once considered impossible.</li><li>Due to the rise in worldly travels due to globalization, traditional cultures are fading or are being fused to create new cultures in Kenya. The urban contemporary culture is synonymous with city dwellers in Kenya. These breeds of people do not associate with the traditional cultural norms and values. The traditional cultures are slowly being replaced or are dying in Kenya and there is a need to do something to preserve them.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1c75ef6a6b09c657.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of SMEs in Kenya: Top 100 companies to watch in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Effects of globalization have influenced a lot of change in countries all over the world. Positive and negative effects are taken into consideration. As much as people like to focus on the pros of globalization, it Is also important to note down the cons. Globalization may have strengthened the global economy, but the living standards of people may have decreased from a lack of attention to children and a shortage of food and water around the world. Good or bad, stronger countries are gaining power and wealth in the process and developing countries are suffering from it.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ MORE: Features and symbolism of Swahili architecture</strong></p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Bl25wcXFdpby0tdOirZ5lnpq0osDIr5xmnZabsqTA0maepaeSlrmqxsCtoKimXp3Brrg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f285989-positive-negative-effects-globalization-html.html&text=Positive%20and%20negative%20effects%20of%20globalization&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f285989-positive-negative-effects-globalization-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f285989-positive-negative-effects-globalization-html.html&title=Positive%20and%20negative%20effects%20of%20globalization" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f285989-positive-negative-effects-globalization-html.html&title=Positive%20and%20negative%20effects%20of%20globalization" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f285989-positive-negative-effects-globalization-html.html&title=Positive%20and%20negative%20effects%20of%20globalization" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f285989-positive-negative-effects-globalization-html.html&description=Positive%20and%20negative%20effects%20of%20globalization" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rory-cochrane-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rory Cochrane - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-castle-diary-tiktok.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What It's Really Like Living in a Medieval Italian Castle">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
