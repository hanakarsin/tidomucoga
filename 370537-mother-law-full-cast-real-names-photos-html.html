The family drama is divided into episodes, with each seemingly addressing a bundle of unique familial issues.</p><p class=align-left>The television series is set in a typical family setting in one of the modern homes in Kenya. It demonstrates the existence of a middle-class Kenyan family. The storyline depicts the actions of a mother-in-law towards her husband, sons, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren.
