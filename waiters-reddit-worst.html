The first step was asking for either a roll, sliced bread, or a wrap. I would go up and ask for a roll and when they gave me one I would very angrily say, "That's a bun!" According to the FDA, there is no difference between a roll and a bun, but the kids didn't know that. So they would frantically look at their assortment before I said, "Ugh. Forget it!" and stormed off.</p><p>I did this every week for years and no one ever caught on. I think I can safely say I am someone's worst customer, and I am okay with that.

Bits of food fell on the ground as well, so I grabbed a towel to clean it up. I look the man in the eye to let him now im on the floor cleaning next to him. He then proceeds to stand up and step on my hand as he walks to the bathroom. It hurt like a bitch, and I yelled out in pain. He didn't acknowledge it at all but chuckled as he walked away. Sadly there wasn't much I could do, I just got angry and walked to the back to calm down.<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>niftyfat</strong></a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Go back to England if you want to speak only English!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>CharmainKB's comment from discussion "Waiters and waitresses of Reddit, what is the most horrible experience you have had with a customer?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Does she know how Subway works?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Br1lliantJim's comment from discussion "Waiters and waitresses of Reddit, what is the most horrible experience you have had with a customer?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tread lightly.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Joshua_notJosh's comment from discussion "Waiters and waitresses of Reddit, what is the most horrible experience you have had with a customer?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Well, it did grab her attention.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>MindyS1719's comment from discussion "Waiters and waitresses of Reddit, what is the most horrible experience you have had with a customer?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why not just eat the clam chowder?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>flylikeIdo's comment from discussion "Waiters and waitresses of Reddit, what is the most horrible experience you have had with a customer?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">It isn't his fault he doesn't understand how restaurants work.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>_pelvic_sorcery_'s comment from discussion "Waiters and waitresses of Reddit, what is the most horrible experience you have had with a customer?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">He ended up starving to death.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>killedmybrotherfor's comment from discussion "Waiters and waitresses of Reddit, what is the most horrible experience you have had with a customer?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">People are the worst.</h2>A family of six dined and dashed on Thanksgiving. It was already a rough thing to be working a family holiday, knowing my tribe was at home enjoying themselves- but to have to miss out on what should have been a good tip; it was just salt in the wound. At the end of the night, I just cried. All of the servers rallied around me and tried to offer me a portion of their tips to make up for a loss. I couldn't accept it, so they got me drunk and drove me home instead. They are awesome people.<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ApatheticMedic</strong></a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Oof.</h2>I'm gonna mix things up and tell y'all about a time that I was the idiot when I was a server. These three black women came into the restaurant with their four little kids and I led them to their table, welcomed them, yadda yadda. By the time I was asking what they wanted to drink, the kids were already bored and had started climbing on the tables and chairs. I honestly thought it was cute so I said, without thinking, "aw you have a little family of monkeys!" Immediately, I realized my mistake. My eyes widened in horror as theirs widened in surprise. I hoped they would ignore it but one of the women turned to the two and loudly asked "did this bitch really just" and I ran away. I served them their food and spent an entire hour avoiding eye contact as I didn't know what I could say that wouldn't make things worse. When they left and I went to collect the bill, one of the women actually left me a really good tip and a note that just said "it's okay!" With a smiley face. I hope her life is full of sunshine and happiness and goodness.<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>kp1602279</strong></a>&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><p>Almost enough to make you want to eat at home, am I right?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ6fpLFwfo9qbmhoZGR%2BeHu0sKqobl%2BsrqrAxKuqZqqVmbGqwIywpqurpA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwaiters-reddit-worst.html&text=Horror%20Stories%20from%20Waitresses&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwaiters-reddit-worst.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwaiters-reddit-worst.html&title=Horror%20Stories%20from%20Waitresses" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwaiters-reddit-worst.html&title=Horror%20Stories%20from%20Waitresses" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwaiters-reddit-worst.html&title=Horror%20Stories%20from%20Waitresses" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwaiters-reddit-worst.html&description=Horror%20Stories%20from%20Waitresses" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./276800-karua-loses-high-court-upholds-waigurus-win-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Karua loses again after High Court upholds Waiguru's win">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./deniece-williams-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Deniece Williams - Age, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
