They held that these dues ran into millions of naira and that the act was perpetrated by the government through the controversial Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System (IPPIS).</p><p>A former Governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Kalu, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to grant amnesty to the detained members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Yoruba Nation agitators.</p><p>Naija News reports that IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu and some members of the proscribed group are being detained in the custody of the Department of State Service (DSS).</p><p>Also, some Yoruba Nation agitators and supporters of Sunday ‘Igboho’ Adeyemo are being detained in the custody of the Nigeria Police Force.</p><p>But in a statement he personally on Tuesday, the Senate Chief Whip and Senator representing Abia North Senatorial District in the National Assembly demanded that all arrested agitators should be released.</p><p>The lawmaker added that granting all detained agitators amnesty will show that the federal government is fair and that will improve unity in the country.</p><p>Kalu, however, asked the government to give all detained IPOB members and Yoruba Nationa agitators the same treatment as repentant Boko Haram insurgents and bandits.</p><p>An ex-Boko Haram commander who has ‘repented’ and submitted to troops of the Nigerian Army has disclosed that the true leaders of the terrorist group don’t go to the battlefields.</p><p>According to him, the majority of those killed or captured by the troops in recent times are ordinary fighters or low-ranking commanders of the dreaded group.</p><p>The ex-fighter identified as Adamu Rugurugu further disclosed that the top leaders are fond of sending them to the battlefronts to die while they remain faraway and secured in the strongholds.</p><p>Rugurugu made the disclosures in a video clip as reported by PR Nigeria where he added that most of them were recruited into the Boko Haram terrorist group against their wish, indoctrinated, and sent to the battlefields to carry out operations.</p><p>He told others who are yet to surrender to do so and lay down their arms, noting that the promise made to them by the leaders about doing it for God and a special reward for them in paradise is nothing but pure scam.</p><p>Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has barred civil servants who have not been vaccinated from going to work.</p><p>Naija News recalls Obaseki had declared that starting from the second week of September, people in the state will be required to show their COVID-19 vaccination cards before gaining access to public spaces.</p><p>Following the directive, a group went to court, seeking to restrain the government from carrying out its threat but the governor stood his ground.</p><p>In a statement on Tuesday by the Permanent Secretary, Edo State Ministry of Health, Osamwonyi Irowa, said the government with effect from September 15, 2021, will commence the enforcement of the “no vaccination card, no access to public places” policy.</p><p>According to Irowa, all those who are yet to take the COVID-19 vaccine have also been barred from accessing public places.</p><p>Aggrieved members of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) have rejected Evelyn, the late Prophet TB Joshua’s widow, as the new leader of the Church, insisting that the late founder expected his successor to be from among the Pastors in the Church whom he had anointed.</p><p>They contended that Evelyn had no basis parading herself as the new leader of SCOAN, claiming that she was neither anointed a Pastor by Joshua nor was she among the founding members of the Church.</p><p>Naija News recalls that SCOAN had, in a statement posted on its Facebook page, announced that the activities of the Church would be directed by Evelyn and called on its members and followers to pray for the wife of the late televangelist as she takes over the leadership role.</p><p>But in a statement issued in Akure under the auspices of the Global Congress of SCOAN Members, (GCSM) and signed by one Adedeji Opeyemi, President of GCSM, and Secretary, Mr. Brown Chimieze, the SCOAN members rejected Evelyn as leader and adduced reasons for their position.</p><p>They claimed that the rule of SCOAN has been swept aside by a few members whom they alleged were building stumbling blocks against the progress of the Church and urged all Christians and people all over the world to help in sustaining the church from ruin.</p><p>Six Nigerians have been list by the United Arab Emirates as financiers of Boko Haram and other criminal activities.</p><p>According to WAM news agency, the list was released after the Emirate federal cabinet met in the capital Abu Dhabi on Monday.</p><p>Nigerians placed on the watch list were Abdurrahaman Ado Musa, Salihu Yusuf Adamu, Bashir Ali Yusuf, Muhammed Ibrahim Isa, Ibrahim Ali Alhassan and Surajo Abubakar Muhammad.</p><p>This is coming after the UAE accused an official of the Nigerian government of sponsoring the terrorist group which has killed thousands of people in the country.</p><p>The Emirate authorities are yet to release the name of the official, amidst reports that some people in Nigeria are mounting diplomatic pressure not to publish the name.</p><p>The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in a bid to close ranks among disgruntled members of the party has named a National Reconciliation Committee.</p><p>The nine-member committee is chaired by Senator Abdullahi Adamu with Otunba Moses Alake Adeyemo as the secretary.</p><p>The National Secretary, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe who made this known in a statement on Tuesday said the date for the inauguration of the committee will be announced later.</p><p>Former Governor and Senator representing Nasarawa West, Abdullahi Adamu, has kicked against the zoning of the presidency to the southeast in 2023.</p><p>Speaking to newsmen at a media parley on Monday, the Senate Committee Chairman on Agriculture stated that zoning the presidential ticket to any zone is not backed by the constitution.</p><p>According to him, the 1999 Constitution (as amended) did not mandate political parties to zone presidency or any other political office to any part of Nigeria.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspapers headlines for today.
