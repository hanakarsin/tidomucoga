Chade wrote in a text overlay of the video.</p><p>And sure, while anyone can say that their church is confusing Obi-Wan Kenobi as their lord and savior, Jesus Christ, Chad proves it, by recording the interior of what appears to be a Christmas celebration at the house of Worship, which shows both adults and kids rocking Santa hats as part of the holiday festivities.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @chadmarvelous</span></figure><p>He pans his camera over the left to reveal a portrait of Jesus, only to zoom in and reveal that the man's countenance isn't actually Ewan McGregor's portrayal of the famed <a href=#>Star Wars</a> hero and Jedi Master.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The TikToker added in a caption for the video: "at a Christmas event, endless church has a picture of #EwanMcGregor as #ObiWanKenobi on the wall. when I asked someone why, they looked at me confused, and said "that's Jesus", and they were completely serious.

In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit post uploaded to the r/thathappened</a> sub, someone shared a photograph that shows a similar Obi-Wan picture up on someone's mantle.</p><p>The picture, was has been turned into a widely circulated meme, contains a caption which says: "A Grandma had this picture on her mantle because she thought it was Jesus...."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It shows McGregor's face decked out in a beard and full Jedi regalia besides a cross and a small black sheet of paper that reads: "Keep Calm Jesus Loves You"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Whether or not the image is genuine and actually belongs to someone's Grandma who gazes upon McGregor's face and thinks about all of the suffering he endured at the hands of Pontius Pilate and the Romans in order to bring a message of love and healing to mankind is up for debate, but it's hard to deny that the aesthetics of his character don't almost directly align with classical religious imagery that's usually associated with Jesus Christ.</p><p>And it would seem that there are plenty of examples where folks have been captured has possessing this same exact opinion: like when a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guy gifted his mother a portrait of Obi-Wan for Christmas</a> and told his mother it was actually a painting of Jesus Christ.</p><p>He even got video of the entire thing.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube | @Antelope Aisle</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There were some Star Wars fans who thought that Lucas' decision to make Obi-Wan resemble typical religious iconography depicting Jesus was one that was intentional, like this one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quora</a> user who wrote: "Is there a reason that Obi-Wan Kenobi resembles Jesus in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith?"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One user thought that OP was just letting memes get the better of his line of thinking: "No, it’s just a meme. You’re reading too much into it. Just because someone has a beard, does not make them Jesus."</p><p>However there was someone else who delineated a short list of reasons as to why Obi-Wan was made to look this way, suggesting that George Lucas knew exactly what he was doing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter | @tankstance</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Arguably, Obi-Wan is a literary “Christ Figure.” That’s about character resemblance not physical resemblance.
