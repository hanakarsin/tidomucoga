Shots in the dark. The “mergatory.” The New Era of 'Survivor' is full of new twists and turns.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jhDJkI eZknfg">Jamie Lerner</a><p class="sc-ensa-Dq fPmIpI">Apr. 4 2024, Published 9:06 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Every season of <a href=#>Survivor</a> hits a turning point at the merge when a game of tribes becomes individual. In <a href=#>Survivor 46</a>, that turning point came in Episode 6 during <a href=#>the “mergatory,”</a> a limbo between the official merge and the tribal portion of the game. In <a href=#>the New Era</a>, the mergatory has become a tradition, but it wasn’t always like that.</p><p>For old-school Survivor fans just picking up the show again after years of watching, this part of the game might be a bit confusing. Since the mergatory has now happened for the sixth time in a row, <a href=#>host Jeff Probst</a> didn’t give it as much explanation as he normally does. But don’t worry! We’re here to explain what the mergatory is.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The “Mergatory” is a phase of ‘Survivor’ in between the team and individual phases of the game.</h2><p>If you think of Survivor as having two phases — the tribes and the individual phases — the “mergatory” falls somewhere in between. It actually didn’t get its name from the Survivor producers but from the players who felt “stuck” in it, often credited to Season 41 player Tiffany Seely. It’s a mashup between “the merge” and “purgatory” symbolizing this phase that’s essentially a limbo in the game.</p><p>In every season of Survivor before Season 41, when players were told to “drop their buffs,” it was either because of a tribe swap or a full merge. They would almost always get a new buff (the exception being players sent to Exile Island in a couple of seasons). But in the New Era, when the castaways drop their buffs, they don’t automatically get a new one.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Instead, castaways are split into two temporary “teams” via a random rock draw to compete against one another in an immunity challenge. Whichever team wins the challenge also wins immunity in the next Tribal Council, during which all remaining players of the game vote. In addition, there’s typically one player left over, who has the option to side with whichever team they think will win and therefore stick with them, win or lose.</p><p>So, for example, in Survivor 46, Tiffany chose correctly and sided with the winning team. Seven players were immune and six were vulnerable at Tribal Council, but all 13 were able to cast a vote (unless they previously lost their vote through a disadvantage). After the voted-out player was eliminated, the remaining five “vulnerable” castaways got their buffs and officially joined the merge.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>imagine if instead of mergeatory we just had a tribe swap down to two tribes for the next two votes and then we merged and everyone got to eat and also be on the jury wouldn’t that be cool <a href=#>#survivor</a></p>— Sami Cappa (@samicappa) <a href=#>April 4, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The “mergatory” is a controversial aspect of the New Era of ‘Survivor.’</h2><p>According to Jeff, players now need to “earn the merge.” Many have argued that this is silly — players already earn the merge by getting to that point in the game. But podcaster Rob Cesternino argues on RHAP that the “mergatory” is a version of a tribe swap. In older seasons, the merge doesn’t typically come until there are only 10 players left, although that was increased to 12 players in certain seasons.</p><p>Often before the merge, tribes would swap from three tribes to two tribes for one or two episodes. This would often create new dynamics in the challenges and in Tribal Council. The “mergatory” is essentially just a version of this, except that all players have a say in who goes home.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mergeatory where anything can happen!!! Can you believe the two people on the bottom of their tribes are the two targets??? GAG!!!! <a href=#>#survivor</a></p>— regis-su (@regissphilbin) <a href=#>April 4, 2024</a></figure><p>But it does create some unfair dynamics. For instance, only the team that wins the challenge gets to actually enjoy the Merge Feast, which used to be a milestone for many Survivor players. This also sets them up with more calories and energy for future challenges in the individual portion of the game. In addition, the winning team, which is typically a majority because of the random seventh person who can often correctly predict who will win, has much more power in the vote, which can decide the direction of the game.</p><p>At least it’s not as bad as the Season 41 and 42 hourglass twist, officially called the “Change History Advantage.” In those seasons, the mergatory came with an additional twist in which an extra player was sent to Exile Island and had the option to turn back time by smashing an hourglass. In doing so, the team that lost would then be given immunity. But players and fans were so upset by this unfair twist of fate that it was removed from subsequent seasons.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Once again, the vote tonight would be way more entertaining if only one person was safe <a href=#>#survivor</a> <a href=#>#survivor46</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/N4bcyVdAMT</a></p>— faithful conquerer (@Doom_scrollin) <a href=#>April 4, 2024</a></figure><p>Now that we’re six seasons into the mergatory, are we accustomed to it? Or is it still a twist that should go to Ghost Island, along with the hourglass twist, the Medallion of Power, and several other Survivor twists that should never again see the light of day?</p><p>New episodes of Survivor air every Wednesday at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmasmJp6rrHRoJyarJ%2Bnxm6%2F1Kutoq6fpw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-the-mergeatory-survivor.html&text=What%20Is%20the%20Mergatory%20in%20Survivor%3f%20Fans%20Aren%27t%20Impressed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-the-mergeatory-survivor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-mergeatory-survivor.html&title=What%20Is%20the%20Mergatory%20in%20Survivor%3f%20Fans%20Aren%27t%20Impressed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-the-mergeatory-survivor.html&title=What%20Is%20the%20Mergatory%20in%20Survivor%3f%20Fans%20Aren%27t%20Impressed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-mergeatory-survivor.html&title=What%20Is%20the%20Mergatory%20in%20Survivor%3f%20Fans%20Aren%27t%20Impressed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-the-mergeatory-survivor.html&description=What%20Is%20the%20Mergatory%20in%20Survivor%3f%20Fans%20Aren%27t%20Impressed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Year Old Celebrities | Famous Birthdays">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sinatu-ojikutu.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Read All The Latest News About Sinatu Ojikutu On Naija News">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
