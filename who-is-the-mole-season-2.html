Season 2 of <a href=#>Netflix</a>'s reboot of <a href=#>The Mole</a> is finally here, and 12 strangers are teaming up to boost a collective prize pot that only one of them will take home in the end.</p><p>But wait, there's a major twist — one of the <a href=#>contestants is "the Mole,"</a> tasked with secretly sabotaging the group's efforts and preventing them from adding any money to the pot.</p><p>With the Season 2 finale now available to stream, both the contestants and viewers have uncovered the identity of "the Mole." If you're eager to find out too, keep scrolling!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is "the Mole" in Season 2 of Netflix's 'The Mole?'</h2><p>In a dramatic moment during the Season 2 finale, host Ari Shapiro asks the final three contestants, Muna, Sean, and Michael, to stand before the entire cast. He then calls for the Mole to step forward.</p><p>We expect Michael to move, but to our surprise, <a href=#>Sean</a> steps forward, unmasking himself as the Mole. Talk about the plot twist of the century, right?!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bonnie Yap/Netflix</span></figure><p>The rest of the cast is utterly speechless, agreeing that Sean played such a great game and admitting he was never a top suspect. They warmly welcome him back in with open arms, and Sean is deeply thankful that his actions haven't affected their personal relationships.</p><p>"You know what, I'm so proud of Sean," Deanna says in a confessional. "I think he deserves an Oscar for some of his performances. He did so good!"</p><p>As the group gathers for their last discussion, Ari turns to Sean and brings up his initial introduction as a stay-at-home dad. However, there's a little bit more to the story.</p><p>"So, I am a legit stay-at-home dad. That's not a lie. But, the last eight and a half years of my career, I was an undercover narcotics investigator and, I worked alongside the DEA," Sean reveals, leaving the group stunned.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Sean continues, "I had the long beard, the long hair. I would do narcotics reversals, money reversals. A lot of my training was reading people. It's building a quick rapport with people, extracting information, and using it against them, and that's what I wanted to do in this game."</p><p>When asked about what's more intense — being the Mole or working as an undercover narcotics investigator — Sean confesses that being the Mole is far more stressful.</p><p>"I was legit stressing before each mission because ... I wanted to be as covert as I possibly could as if I was working again in my real life. I didn't want to be made by anybody," Sean explains. "And these people, these 11 people, are from every different class of the world. They're intelligent, beautiful, smart, educated. Criminals are dumb! You can get them to tell you anything if you do enough. And these are 11 smart people, I'm like, 'Yo, this is going to be difficult.'"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Ari then shows a highlight reel of Sean's sabotage throughout the season, beginning with the very first mission. Sean admits that from the start, his intention was to cost the group money. During the treasure hunt, he deliberately cut knots that were too short for the contestants to use. In a surprising revelation during the tower heist, Sean confesses that he actually loves heights and isn't afraid of them at all, despite pretending otherwise.</p><p>Although his cover was nearly blown during movie night, Sean managed to evade suspicion. Additionally, at the silent auction, he strategically provoked a bidding war by implying he was aiming for an exemption, ultimately draining the prize pot.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Ultimately, Ari observes that the Sean we see now is a stark contrast to the Sean during the game. Sean confesses his intention to go undercover, explaining, "I wanted to be this bumbling, goofy, average white dad of America."</p><p>Hannah can't help but praise Sean, saying he "played the best 'useless dad' in the entire world." Meanwhile, Melissa and a few others confess they never would have suspected Sean was the Mole.</p><p>Season 2 of The Mole is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZK2glWK6sLjEZqqemaOku25%2B</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-the-mole-season-2.html&text=Who%20Is%20the%20Mole%20in%20Season%202%20of%20Netflix%27s%20The%20Mole%3f%20Spoilers%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-the-mole-season-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-mole-season-2.html&title=Who%20Is%20the%20Mole%20in%20Season%202%20of%20Netflix%27s%20The%20Mole%3f%20Spoilers%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-the-mole-season-2.html&title=Who%20Is%20the%20Mole%20in%20Season%202%20of%20Netflix%27s%20The%20Mole%3f%20Spoilers%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-mole-season-2.html&title=Who%20Is%20the%20Mole%20in%20Season%202%20of%20Netflix%27s%20The%20Mole%3f%20Spoilers%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-the-mole-season-2.html&description=Who%20Is%20the%20Mole%20in%20Season%202%20of%20Netflix%27s%20The%20Mole%3f%20Spoilers%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./william-phipps-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="William Phipps - Trivia, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./406260-usher-net-worth-2021-how-wealthy-rnb-musician-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Usher net worth in 2021: How wealthy is the RnB musician?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
