Then he was like, we can only just pray.</i></p><p class=p1><i>“I was like, how can God be? What can we do to make sure she is okay? Then he started explaining how God works. And you know when you are in a desperate situation like that, whatever a person tells you is going to be a gospel at that time. So, he explained to me that we can just pray. This is how God works. This is what God can do for her.</i></p><p class=p1><i>“Then I went to pray. I prayed and prayed and prayed. I was only 3, could you imagine?
