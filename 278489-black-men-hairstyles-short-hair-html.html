There are different shades of this hairstyle with an underlying trait of short hair all around the head. This cut is popularly made using electric clippers, which is buzzed atop of your hair to achieve a clean and uniform (or short styled hair that is not uniform) short hair. The picture above portrays the true reflection of the short buzz cut, with a regular haircut around the head. It can be made better with a sharp cut at the front hair lining and around the head, on the hairline, giving your head a well-defined demarcation, that is both pretty and sophisticated. This type of haircut can be added to the list of official haircuts for black men or short hairstyles for black men, both of which, it serves its purpose quite well. The different shades of buzz cut include buzz cut fade and edge up, mid skin fade and buzz cut, short buzzed and tapered sides, among others.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1a31a58f44080ce9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bowl cut girl ideas - 20+ pictures</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: 25 best kids hairstyles for boys</strong></p><h2><strong>2. Afro fade</strong></h2><p class=align-left>For Kenyan music lovers, this style is quite common among the local artists, particularly Pascal Tokodi, the Sitaki hit-song maker and a talented actor. Kenyans of ordinary status have also embraced this style, more so, those in major towns and cities. Short sides and unkempt or wild curly tops characterize the style. The style requires less maintenance as opposed to box fade, giving room for more natural hair to grow from the top. Depending on your preference, the hair from the sides and back are then faded to form skin bald, high and low fade. It is not out of order for anyone to say that the afro fade is part of the list of black male urban hairstyles.</p><h2><strong>3. Curls with fade</strong></h2><p class=align-left>If you are looking for curly hairstyles for black men, curls with fade are your right fit. This type of haircut has a close resemblance to the afro fade, the only difference between the two is the hair texture. Curls with fade are best suited for those whose hair isn’t tough enough to form the afro fade rather have loose curls or forms ringlets. Both the back and sides of the head fade to contrast the curls on top of the head. The curly top can be loosely styled or designed as per your preference, both of which bring out a sense of style that is creative and handsome. This hairstyle qualifies as one of black male youth hairstyles as well as black male urban hairstyles.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8d8454c83b9516ed.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 best short haircuts for little girls: Long, short, curly hairstyles</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs7qlfqs8i2pu.jpeg><h2><strong>4.

Flattop</strong></h2><p class=align-left>There are two variations of the flattop, the longer-high top fade, and the short flattop.
