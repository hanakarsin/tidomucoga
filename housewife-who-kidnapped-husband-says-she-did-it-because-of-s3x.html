Even when my father and mother inlaws were alive he abandoned me. He never cared for his children. I engaged in menial jobs such as weeding on people’s farms to feed my children and pay their school fees.</p><p>“One of the children finished from secondary school and I approached my husband to plan how to send the son to learn trade since the father refused to send him to university but my husband shunned me. The major reason I arranged for his kidnapping is that my husband refused to have sex with me and does not take care of me and the children.”</p><p>She, however, insisted that she did not collect her share of the ransom from the abductors before she was apprehended.</p><p>“The kidnapper that collected the ransom of N2million never gave my share and I don’t even see the money. It was when the kidnappers were sharing the N2m that the police arrested them and they mentioned me. They never gave me any part of the ransom collected from my husband.</p><p>“The kidnap kingpin (now at large) identified as Udo Moji assured me that he would collect the money from my husband for me since my husband attacked me and poured soup on me. So, I agreed with him and he kidnapped my husband. I ran around to gather money to pay the kidnappers. The main suspect, Udo moji ran away,” she added.</p><p>Sharing his side of the story, the husband of the suspect, <strong>Emmanuel Sampson Ebong</strong>, who hails from Ntak Obio Akpa in Oruk Anam Local Government Area of the state said, “I was kidnapped on July 21, 2022 in my compound.</p><p>“I came back from where I went for treatment because I was weak. Around 8.30pm, I saw about six people in my compound. They struggled with me and fired two gunshots into the air, I struggled with them before they took me out of my compound in a minibus and drove away.</p><p>“They kept me from that Thursday till Sunday and demanded N10m from me and later reduced it to N2m before the police came that day, If not for God, they would have killed me.</p><p>“They took me to Etinan where they kept me. I thank the Nigeria Police for the rescue operations. I also thank my Village Head. I don’t know the reason they kidnapped me, they collected N2m from me. The police later recovered over N500,000 from them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49rZqGnpaiyuLXFnmSwoJ9iuKqwzZqnqZ2UYrW2v8GapZ1lo5bGtHnSoZxmnJmZeqrAjJucnJmlqLJuu8VmqmywXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhousewife-who-kidnapped-husband-says-she-did-it-because-of-s3x.html&text=Housewife%20Who%20Kidnapped%20Husband%20Says%20She%20Did%20It%20Because%20Of%20S3x&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhousewife-who-kidnapped-husband-says-she-did-it-because-of-s3x.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhousewife-who-kidnapped-husband-says-she-did-it-because-of-s3x.html&title=Housewife%20Who%20Kidnapped%20Husband%20Says%20She%20Did%20It%20Because%20Of%20S3x" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhousewife-who-kidnapped-husband-says-she-did-it-because-of-s3x.html&title=Housewife%20Who%20Kidnapped%20Husband%20Says%20She%20Did%20It%20Because%20Of%20S3x" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhousewife-who-kidnapped-husband-says-she-did-it-because-of-s3x.html&title=Housewife%20Who%20Kidnapped%20Husband%20Says%20She%20Did%20It%20Because%20Of%20S3x" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhousewife-who-kidnapped-husband-says-she-did-it-because-of-s3x.html&description=Housewife%20Who%20Kidnapped%20Husband%20Says%20She%20Did%20It%20Because%20Of%20S3x" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./november15-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="November 15 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./david-mann-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Mann - Age, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
