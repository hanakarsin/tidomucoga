Why did they cancel 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians'?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: E! Network</span></figure><p>There are some reality television shows that seem to come and go almost as fast as the season aired, and then there are a few that seem to go on forever. Those long-standing ones are far and few between, but there's one show that's lasted far longer than anyone thought. So, why did they cancel <a href=#>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</a>?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' has been on air since 2007.</h2><p>The television show, which airs on E!, made the Kardashian / Jenner clan household names. First airing in 2007, the show featured Kris, Caitlyn, Kendall, and Kylie Jenner alongside Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, and Rob Kardashian. Over time, others became main characters on the show including significant others like Scott Disick and Kanye West, as well as the family's best friends.</p><p>There's no doubt the show has been a huge success. While some people whine and complain, not understanding why the family is famous for just doing what they do, fans spoke by the millions in terms of views. It was one of the most successful shows on E! Network, but it's clear there have been some shifts in its popularity, particularly ahead of the show's 18th season.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Earlier in 2020, people speculated that the show may be nearing its end after the network announced the show would move from its Sunday timeslot to Thursdays, the first time in the show's history. Around the same time, some outlets began to share that the show was dropping in views.&nbsp;</p><p>"The first couple of episodes scored just about 1 million viewers, down from the 1.4 million KUWTK had fallen to in recent seasons," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ShowBiz</a> reported. From there, each episode continued to drop. The drama on the show started to feel forced, and the family didn't seem to be too into it anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit thread</a>, people questioned the drama on the show and the move to Thursday nights as a last-ditch effort to keep viewers. The critics were curious if the show had moved from Sundays so it no longer had to compete with other reality TV shows, like TLC's 90 Day Fiancé, which has grown significantly in popularity.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / kuwtk</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did they cancel 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians'?</h2><p>On Sept. 8, 2020, several members of the Kardashian-Jenner family announced on social media that the show was going to end after Season 20.&nbsp;</p><p>"To our amazing fans," Kim Kardashian West wrote on Instagram. "It is with heavy hearts that we’ve made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians. After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who’ve watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children."&nbsp;</p><p>She went on to say that she will "cherish the wonderful memories" and gave thanks to the people and businesses that were involved in the show.&nbsp;</p><p>"Our last season will air early next year in 2021," she said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we’ve made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians. After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who’ve watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We’ll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we’ve met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience and, most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who’ve spent countless hours documenting our lives. Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn’t be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years. This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Kim Kardashian West</a> (@kimkardashian) on Sep 8, 2020 at 2:34pm PDT</p></figure><p>There's been much speculation as to why the show has come to an end.
