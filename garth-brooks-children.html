From 2001 to 2005, Garth officially retired from country music in order to take care of his daughters. He and <a href=#>wife Sandy Mahl</a> separated in 1999 and eventually divorced in 2000. While his marriage seemed to be irreparably damaged, he knew he had to focus on the three daughters he had with Sandy.</p><p>"Once children come into the mix, children take the lead. That's it. They didn't want to come in this place. It wasn't their choice, we brought them in. So even though Sandy and I were not going to be able to complete our marriage, we still had our children to raise," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garth told People</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Garth Brooks' children?</h2><p>Garth Brooks had three daughters with Sandy Mahl: Taylor Mayne Pearl (born in 1992), August Anna (born 1994), and Allie Colleen Brooks (born 1996).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Taylor Mayne Pearl</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Allie Colleen (@alliecolleenmusic)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Taylor Mayne Pearl, 29, studied history at Oklahoma State University from 2010 to 2016. She's extremely private, so you won't be seeing her share photos from her everyday life. Unlike her dad, she never expressed interest in a career in music, but she is interested in philanthropy. In 2019, she played a big role in her family's Habitat for Humanity project. The last we know is that Taylor was studying at a seminary school at Vanderbilt University, where she's getting her Masters in Theology.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">August Anna Brooks Russell</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>August Anna, 27, is also a super private person.

Allie graduated from Nashville's Belmont University and began pursuing her love of country. Her full-length album, Stones, came out in April 2021. She's married to Jonathan Roberts, who's a PE teacher.</p><p>Allie has always claimed that she didn't use her father's connections and has made it her own way.</p><p>“I don’t really have [those] business connections. But ever since I was a kid, my dad has taught me basically one lesson, and that’s to put your head down and work," she told American Songwriter.</p><p>Allie continued: "If I wasn’t where I wanted to be where I was in soccer, it’s because I didn’t work. If I wasn’t where I wanted to be in school, or with my friends, or just with myself, the answer was always to put my head down and work.
