Tinubu described the incumbent leader as a humble and gracious man.</p><p>He said:&nbsp;“We all, not only as a party, it has gone beyond partisan idea now. It is yours as the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. You put it together and you have even gracious and humble from the beginning. We are very grateful to you.”</p><p>According to Tinubu, he never expected that he would win the primary election but that it happened and “I must be intoxicated by the victory. What can I do?”</p><p>The APC candidate, however, apologized to President <strong>Muhammadu Buhari</strong> for keeping him waiting during his address.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that while commending <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Vice President Osinbajo</strong> </a>who was one of his top contenders for the presidential ticket, Tinubu described the nation’s number two citizen as a good supportive pillar to President Buhari.</p><p>He said: “The vice president, a very good and supportive pillar, a good assistant to the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo GCON, we than you for this steady and good support to our president.”</p><p>The former Lagos State governor, however, noted in his speech that he wasn’t happy about Senate President, Ahmed Lawan’s participation in the race, saying: “To you, the legislature, the Senate President, Senator Ahmad Lawan, I would have been a little upset because you competed with me but that is over now since you can easily leak your wounds. It doesn’t take away from thanking you from the past cooperation and cool-headedness to build our country. You have helped in steering the ship of the nation and with your colleagues in the Senate, history is written and will be kind to you.</p><p>Tinubu’s acceptance speech reads further: “And to my brother, Hakeem Gbajabiamila, the sparkling speaker, I credit you. The Gbajabiamilas of Lagos has been part of the history of this country and you will not be forgotten.</p><p>“To the chairman of our party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, it appeared some weeks back that some newspapers and many people were ready to write the obituary of this party. We put together and pulled ourselves as a cat with nine lives. We thatched the roof, steady the pillars and became master builders. You came on and worked hard with the collaboration of others and here we are. Shame on those who were already building the coffin of APC. Shame on them. Our party is alive.</p><p>“They won’t be able to do the convention but here we are, the first convention to choose the. See executives, the governors pulled themselves together, we did break our backs and we are here, very happy and confident and courageous to tell you that the cat that lies down quietly is not a pretension of death but breeding of its energy to devour its enemies. Now we are here, we will roar. We will do it. We will tell Poverty Development Party. They call themselves PDP, 16 years of failures of wastefulness, we day step aside, be buried and leave the way for us. We will repair our country.</p><p>“We are Progressives, we are nation builders. We are not destroyers. We are confident that this nation is back in the track”, he stated.</p><p>Speaking about the state of the nation, especially the incessant attacks and killings, Tinubu said; “We are not the barbaric, blind human beings they think we are. They are setting us against in another. When you were born, you didn’t hear from the womb whether you would be a male or female, Christian or Muslim. You were born to your parents and adopted their religions and you continued.</p><p>“The Bible taught us to love your neighbour as you love yourself. It did not say kill your neighbour. It is in the two holy books. Goodness for goodness. Learn to accept mistakes, not from gunshots or the destruction of lives and property because the life you take you cannot bring back, and the hate you spill cannot cure your hunger. We must build a new society and learn to think a new way of life”.</p><p>Tinubu commended all his fellow aspirants for the stiff and strong opposition they offered which he said made the party better and himself humble. He also lauded all the seven aspirants who stepped down for him saying it was a very difficult decision that they made.</p><p>“The competition is now over. Those who did not support me, you have nothing to fear. I hold no grudges. Let us join hands to beat the PDP and beat back their retrogressive understanding of Nigeria. They had 16 years, they depleted our resources and left us with hunger. Let us dig their graves by defeating them in the next election because they are the agents of poverty, terror, violence and lying”, Tinubu added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e49xZpuqlZa4qrrGZquipqWXwrR5wJyanqiklruksYysp56dk516orLTnqlmr5mju6q6xmaYqZtdpb%2BqucCroJ6rXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbreaking-tinubus-acceptance-speech-after-winning-apc-primaries.html&text=Tinubus%20Acceptance%20Speech%20After%20Winning%20APC%20Primaries&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbreaking-tinubus-acceptance-speech-after-winning-apc-primaries.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbreaking-tinubus-acceptance-speech-after-winning-apc-primaries.html&title=Tinubus%20Acceptance%20Speech%20After%20Winning%20APC%20Primaries" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbreaking-tinubus-acceptance-speech-after-winning-apc-primaries.html&title=Tinubus%20Acceptance%20Speech%20After%20Winning%20APC%20Primaries" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbreaking-tinubus-acceptance-speech-after-winning-apc-primaries.html&title=Tinubus%20Acceptance%20Speech%20After%20Winning%20APC%20Primaries" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbreaking-tinubus-acceptance-speech-after-winning-apc-primaries.html&description=Tinubus%20Acceptance%20Speech%20After%20Winning%20APC%20Primaries" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1237461-fati-washa-ta-samu-mabiya-miliyan-1-a-shafin-instagram-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fati Washa ta samu mabiya Miliyan 1 a shafin Instagram">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./416007-raila-atajiondoa-kwenye-kinyanganyiro-cha-2022-moses-kuria-asema-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Raila Atajiondoa Kwenye Kinyang'anyiro cha 2022, Moses Kuria Asema">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
