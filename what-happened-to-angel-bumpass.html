The mother of two was recently convicted for a murder that occurred when she was 13 years old — but something doesn't add up.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: A&E</span></figure><p>Was a 13-year-old girl really responsible for the 2009 killing of a 68-year-old man? That’s what a jury determined in October when they found <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angel Bumpass</a> guilty of first-degree felony murder and attempt to commit especially aggravated robbery.</p><p>The key piece of evidence against the now 25-year-old mother of two was a pair of fingerprints recovered from the duct tape used to bind and suffocate the victim — but what about the overwhelming amount of evidence pointing to Bumpass’ innocence? Prosecutors didn’t seem to care.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Angel Bumpass?</h2><p>Nearly a decade after the horrific death of Franklin Bonner, a new detective assigned to the cold case retested the fingerprints that came off the duct tape used to restrain the Chattanooga resident on the afternoon of Jan. 16, 2009.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: A&E</span></figure><p>Two of the prints matched Bumpass, who, according to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">change.org petition</a> demanding a retrial for the aspiring nurse, was an eighth grade honor student at the time of the crime. Prosecutors claimed she and her alleged accomplice, Mallory Vaughn (who is 13 years her senior), targeted Bonner knowing he had money and marijuana.</p><p>But despite testimony from federal inmate Nicholas Cheatom alleging that Vaughn confessed to the murder, he was found not guilty while Bumpass received a life sentence plus eight years for the killing.&nbsp;</p><p>"[Vaughn] told me he messed up," Cheatom shared on the stand. "[He said] he duct-taped someone up like a mummy and it went wrong."</p><p>According to reports, Bumpass won’t be eligible for parole until 2070, but her supporters are determined to see justice properly served.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Angel Bumpass' appeal is currently on hold because of COVID-19.</h2><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> dedicated to overturning Bumpass’ conviction states that she filed an appeal on Dec. 20, 2019, and originally had a hearing scheduled for Feb. 7.&nbsp;</p><p>It was later pushed back to March 27, but in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an update</a> posted on the change.org petition, one of Bumpass’ family members announced that her court date had been moved again "due to the coronavirus outbreak."</p><p>It’s unclear whether Bumpass’ trial attorney, Andrea Hayduk, is representing the young mom in her appeal, but on a recent episode of A&E’s <a href=#>Accused: Guilty or Innocent?</a>, which focused on her client’s case, she expressed disbelief over the outcome.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: A&E</span></figure><p>"I don’t know how to walk out of here and go home to my kids when she’s locked in a cell for the next 60 years," Hayduk tearfully told the camera. "I don’t understand how the system could put a child away for the rest of her life and let the adult walk."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Was Angel Bumpass' grandmother involved?</h2><p>At the time of the murder, Bumpass lived with her grandparents, who reportedly bought marijuana from Mr. Bonner. During her granddaughter’s trial, Shirley Bumpass recalled talking with investigator Karl Fields in 2009 since she was allegedly the last person to call Bonner before his death.</p><p>Shirley explained that although she helped raise Bumpass, she and her husband never had custody of their granddaughter, and lost contact with her when she turned 16.&nbsp;</p><p>They both seemed certain that Bumpass had never stepped foot in Bonner’s house, and despite their association with the victim, neither were ever labeled as suspects in the crime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSappeauW6u1Kanmquj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-angel-bumpass.html&text=Something%27s%20Definitely%20off%20About%20the%20Murder%20Conviction%20of%20Angel%20Bumpass&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-angel-bumpass.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-angel-bumpass.html&title=Something%27s%20Definitely%20off%20About%20the%20Murder%20Conviction%20of%20Angel%20Bumpass" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-angel-bumpass.html&title=Something%27s%20Definitely%20off%20About%20the%20Murder%20Conviction%20of%20Angel%20Bumpass" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-angel-bumpass.html&title=Something%27s%20Definitely%20off%20About%20the%20Murder%20Conviction%20of%20Angel%20Bumpass" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-angel-bumpass.html&description=Something%27s%20Definitely%20off%20About%20the%20Murder%20Conviction%20of%20Angel%20Bumpass" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./aug-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="August Birthdays | Famous Birthdays">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fg-uuncovers-30000-ghost-workers-on-police-payroll.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="FG Exposes 30,000 Ghost Workers On Police Payroll">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
