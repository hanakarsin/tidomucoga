Flight 1227, which was making a trip from Detroit to Atlanta went right back to the gate “following two customers who were non-compliant with crew instructions,” according to reports.</p><p>The flight proceeded as normal to Atlanta after the two passengers were removed from the aircraft. Delta CEO, Ed Bastian has taken a hard stance against customers who refuse to don facial coverings while aboard their aircraft, stating, “You cannot board a Delta plane unless you have a mask on.”</p><p>He continued in his statement to Today, “If you board the plane and you insist on not wearing your mask, we will insist that you don't fly Delta into the future." According to Bastian, the airline had to ban more than 100 fliers since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic because they would not wear face masks while aboard their planes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Bastian didn’t comment as to whether or not these two individuals involved in this specific incident would be banned from Delta flights in the future, however. Delta’s stringent rulings are in line with other airlines as well, who have adopted “masks while flying” rules in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The airline’s official mask policy even goes so far as to recommend passengers who cannot wear a mask during a flight due to health conditions should either be medically cleared to fly first or reconsider travelling via plane altogether.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yesterday, I took the plunge & flew cross-country. Everybody I saw on my <a href=#>@Unlted</a> flight was masked – thanks United (& <a href=#>@Delta</a>, which tossed 2 passengers off yesterday for no masks <a href=#>https://t.co/ho55gao9rP</a>) & to my fellow passengers. I wore mask & face shield, & if felt pretty safe.</p>— Bob Wachter (@Bob_Wachter) <a href=#>August 3, 2020</a></figure><p>This incident comes shortly after a separate Atlanta commuter was removed from a Delta airplane after refusing to put their mask on properly. ClickOnDetroit shared video footage of a man having a “meltdown” after being asked by flight attendants to put his mask on correctly.</p><p>After holding up the flight and causing a scene, he was removed from the airplane to the sounds of applause from fellow passengers. Todd Benson was aboard the flight from Aruba to Atlanta with his family and he called the man’s behavior, “shameful.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Delta correctly enforces its mask policy with two passengers to help protect all on the flight.</p><p>By choosing Delta, one chooses their safety rules from seat belts to face masks. There is no "right" to violate others' safety.<a href=#>#resist</a> <a href=#>#VoteBlue</a> <a href=#>#mepolitics</a><a href=#>https://t.co/a15x0T5UDS</a></p>— Bruce Bourgoine (@BruceBourgoine) <a href=#>July 27, 2020</a></figure><p>He told the outlet, “He was yelling, I have it on I have it on, and he was talking about his mask. The Delta flight attendant was requesting that he put it on properly. Moments later, he’s threatening her. ‘I’m gonna beat you up’ or something along that lines. And I thought that was completely inappropriate. He was saying he was gonna somehow get her fired.”</p><p>The man’s invectives escalated as he was leaving the plane, “As he was leaving the most graphic language that you could possibly imagine just came spewing out of his mouth and I wish we all could have just covered our ears.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not wearing masks on a plane is like smoking in a cancer ward.<a href=#>https://t.co/MiYXq2xXKp</a></p>— Nemesis (@timberjack2004) <a href=#>August 2, 2020</a></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, there aren't any federal guidelines that force airlines to wear masks, instead, businesses are left up to creating their own mask-wearing rules. Alaska asks all passengers over the age of 12 to wear masks, as are American, Delta, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, and United. Allegiant is recommending but not requiring commuters to wear them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbKtwMBmnaWhl53BbsDUq6WsZZGnvLa6w2anmqujmruosdGsZKenXaKutLc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdelta-flight-turns-around-passengers-no-mask.html&text=Yet%20Another%20Flight%20Turns%20Around%20Because%20Passengers%20Wouldn%27t%20Wear%20Masks&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdelta-flight-turns-around-passengers-no-mask.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdelta-flight-turns-around-passengers-no-mask.html&title=Yet%20Another%20Flight%20Turns%20Around%20Because%20Passengers%20Wouldn%27t%20Wear%20Masks" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdelta-flight-turns-around-passengers-no-mask.html&title=Yet%20Another%20Flight%20Turns%20Around%20Because%20Passengers%20Wouldn%27t%20Wear%20Masks" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdelta-flight-turns-around-passengers-no-mask.html&title=Yet%20Another%20Flight%20Turns%20Around%20Because%20Passengers%20Wouldn%27t%20Wear%20Masks" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdelta-flight-turns-around-passengers-no-mask.html&description=Yet%20Another%20Flight%20Turns%20Around%20Because%20Passengers%20Wouldn%27t%20Wear%20Masks" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-monarch-tv-show-based-on-a-real-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Monarch' Is Larger-Than-Life, but Is It Based in Reality?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./67956-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tension In Kano Over Speculations That President Jonathan Has Nullified Sanusis Appointment As Em">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
